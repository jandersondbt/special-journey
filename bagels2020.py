    By Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com

    I am thinking of a {NUM_DIGITS}-digit number with no repeated digits.
    Try to guess what it is. Here are some clues:
    When I say:     That means:
    {GREEN}Pico{RESET}            One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
    {YELLOW}Fermi{RESET}           One digit is correct and in the right position.
    {RED}Bagels{RESET}          No digit is correct.

    For example, if the secret number was 248 and your guess was 843, the
    clues would be Fermi Pico.''')
